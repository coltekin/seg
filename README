This is a new version of the segmentation application (named
creatively as 'seg') that implements a set of incremental algorithms
for learning segmentation described in:

  speech." PhD thesis. University of Groningen

  of learning lexical segmentation using multiple cues. In: Workshop

The earlier version(s) are accessible from
https://github.com/coltekin/seg/.

This particular version includes a major rewrite of the internals of
the application to support UTF-8 encoded input. It currently supports
only the "LM" algorithm, others and potentially more segmentation
algorithms are planned to be implemented within this version.

For proper attribution to the data distributed with this application,
please see the README files under the data/ directory.

The application is written in pure C, you should be able to compile
on any POSIX compliant operating system by simply typing 'make' in the
src/ directory. The resulting command line tool will be called 'seg',
the command './seg -h' gives an overview of options available.
