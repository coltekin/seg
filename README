This program (named creatively as 'seg') implements a set of
incremental algorithms for learning segmentation described in my PhD
thesis and some of the later work. The thesis can be 
found at <http://dissertations.ub.rug.nl/faculties/arts/2011/c.coltekin/>. 

The latest version of this application can be obtained from
<https://bitbucket.org/coltekin/seg>.

Except a standard C compiler and 'make', you need

- GLib -- http://developer.gnome.org/glib/
- GNU scientific library www.gnu.org/s/gsl/
- The command-line options are managed using gengetopt
  <http://www.gnu.org/software/gengetopt/>. Generated cmdline.[ch]
  files are included in the distribution. You do not need to install
  gengetopt, unless you want to change the command line interface.

Typing 'make' should build the executable 'seg'. Here are a few
example runs:

- Segment using predictability cue only, using defaults for the
  context size:
    ./seg -i data/br-phono.txt \
          -m combine \
          --cues=pred \
          --pred-m=mi
- The same, but discard the output, print precision/recall/f-score 
    ./seg -i data/br-phono.txt \
          -o /dev/null \
          -m combine \
          --cues=pred \
          --pred-m=mi \
          --print-prf \
          --print-head
- Combine predictability with measures mi, h, and rh and utterance
  boundaries (with default context options). Again, discard the
  output, and print a LaTex tabular instead of commas-separated values.
    ./seg -i data/br-phono.txt \
          -o /dev/null \
          -m combine \
          --cues=pred,ub \
          --pred-m=mi \
          --print-prf \
          --print-head \
          --print-latex
- Do not segment, but print the PMI value for every possible boundary
  location:
    ./seg -i data/br-phono.txt \
        --print \
        --pred-m=mi

See the output of './seg -h' for more information on how to use it.

The code is tested well, and should work fine on any POSIX-like
environment, but it may not be easy to digest as it also uses some
code from other projects. The command line options may be confusing
and not well-documented at times. I plan to improve the readability
and usability of the software while working on a few future projects I
have in mind.
